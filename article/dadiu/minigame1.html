    <h1>Game Idea</h1>
    <p class="articleBody">We started the process by receiving a children's book we should develop concept ideas from, to get started on the game. The first minigame had five weekdays of production from wednesday to wednesday.</p>
    <p class="articleBody">From a few pages of the book where the girl is in the dark forest and is met by a scary troll, our game starts out as a runner, where you play as the girl being chased by the troll.</p>
    <p class="articleBody">The game is made for tablet, specifically we tested and build for the android device. The input controls are tapping to move the character around, and drag and drop to shoot in-game ammunition.</p>
