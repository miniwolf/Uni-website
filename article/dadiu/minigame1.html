    <p class="articleBody">I am currently involved in a project named <a href="http://www.dadiu.dk">DADIU</a>. Here we are taught the process of game development, in a team of 15-20 people with people in the field of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Animator</li>
        <li>Art Director</li>
        <li>Audio Designer</li>
        <li>CG Artist</li>
        <li>Game Designer</li>
        <li>Game Director</li>
        <li>Game Programmers</li>
        <li>Level Designer</li>
        <li>Project Manager</li>
        <li>QA Manager</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="articleBody">The project is structured to simulate a real world game development setting in a larger production. We learn a lot about the processes, collaboration and problem solving. The first part of the project, is 2 mini game productions where we figure out what is going wrong in our development and try to come up with solutions to specific issues that arrise.</p>
    <h1>Game Idea</h1>
    <p class="articleBody">We started the process by receiving a children's book from which we should develop concept ideas to get started on the game. The first minigame had five weekdays of production from wednesday to wednesday.</p>
    <p class="articleBody">Taken from a few pages of the book where the girl is in the dark forest and is met by a scary troll, our game starts out as a runner, where you play as the girl being chased by the troll.</p>
    <p class="articleBody">The game is made for tablet, specifically we tested and build for the android nexus 9. The input controls are tapping to move the character around, and drag and drop to shoot in-game ammunition.</p>
